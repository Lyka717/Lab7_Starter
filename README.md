1) I would run my tests locally before pushing the code since the website will be live and anything that may be pushed, which can be a bug, can be live on the website already before getting properly tested.
2) No, we would not use end-to-end testing to check if a function is working correctly because end-to-end focuses more on a process (i.e. navigating a website) raher than itteratively looking at each individual function.
3) The difference is the state of the page the mode is analyzing. Snapshot mode is leaning more towards analyizing pages as they are updating or being built. Meanwhile, nagivation mode only analyzes the page after it lodas and reports on overall performance rather than focusing on smaller details like how snapshot mode is.
4) 
   1) One thing that can be improved is to properly resize images used beforehand in order to make load time faster.
   2) Additionally, the `<meta name="viewport">` tag in order to reduce user input delay while also optimizing the page to be mobile-friendly.
   3) We could also have the image preload in order to save on load time.
